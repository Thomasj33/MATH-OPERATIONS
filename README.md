# MATH-OPERATIONS

When programming in the C language, the arithmetic operators help in performing mathematical functions. Arithmetic Operators in C allows a user to construct various formulas and mathematical equations. In this article, we will discuss the arithmetic operators .
Operator	Description	Example
–	Subtraction of the second variable from the first one	var = A – B = -5
+	Addition of two operands	var = A + B = 15
/	Division of the numerator by the de-numerator	var = B / A = 2
*	Multiplication of both the operands	var = A * B = 50
%	The modulus operator and the remainder after the division of an integer	var = B % A = 0
